# Class project for the course "Regression Models", Coursera, Jan 2015

This project was created for the "Regression Models" course, which is part of
the "Data Science" specialization in Coursera, for the session starting on
January 05, 2015.

It was based on the following instructions:

> ## Context
> 
> You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested
> in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the
> following two questions:
>
> - “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
> - "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
>
> ##  Question
>
> Take the `mtcars` data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses
> 
> Your report must be:
> - Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
> - Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
> - Include a first paragraph executive summary.
